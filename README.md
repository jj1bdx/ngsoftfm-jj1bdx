## Introduction

**NGSoftFM** is a software-defined radio receiver for FM broadcast radio. Stereo
decoding is supported. It is written in C++. It is a derivative work of SoftFM (https://github.com/jorisvr/SoftFM) with a new application design and new features. It also corrects wrong de-emphasis scheme for stereo signals.

### Hardware supported

  - **RTL-SDR** based (RTL2832-based) hardware is suppoeted and uses the _librtlsdr_ library to interface with the RTL-SDR hardware.
  - **HackRF** One and variants are supported with _libhackrf_ library.
  - **Airspy** is supported with _libairspy_ library.

### Purposes of NGSoftFM

 - experimenting with digital signal processing and software radio;
 - investigating the stability of the 19 kHz pilot;
 - doing the above while listening to my favorite radio station.

NGSoftFM actually produces pretty good stereo sound
when receiving a strong radio station.  Weak stations are noisy,
but NGSoftFM gets much better results than rtl\_fm (bundled with RTL-SDR)
and the few GNURadio-based FM receivers I have seen.

### NGSoftFM provides

 - mono or stereo decoding of FM broadcasting stations
 - real-time playback to soundcard or dumping to file
 - command-line interface (no GUI, no visualization, nothing fancy)

### NGSoftFM requires

 - Linux / macOS / FreeBSD
 - C++11 (gcc, clang/llvm)
 - [RTL-SDR library](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)
 - [HackRF library](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/tree/master/host/libhackrf)
 - [Airspy library](https://github.com/airspy/host/tree/master/libairspy)
 - [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
 - supported RTL-SDR DVB-T receiver, Airspy, or HackRF Rx/Tx
 - medium-fast computer for RTL-SDR, faster computer for Airspy and HackRF
 - medium-strong FM radio signal. However the R820T2 based dongles give better results than the former R820T based dongles. HackRF, or Airspy are usually even better but you have to spend more for the devices.

### Branches and tags

  - Official releases are tagged
  - _master_ is the "production" branch with the most stable release (often ahead of the latest release though)
  - _dev_ is the development branch that contains current developments that will be eventually released in the master branch
  - Other branches are experimental (and abandoned)

## Prerequisites

### Base requirements

  - `sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libasound2-dev libboost-all-dev`

### RTL-SDR support

The Osmocom RTL-SDR library must be installed before you can build NGSoftFM.
See http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr for more information.
NGSoftFM has been tested successfully with RTL-SDR 0.5.3. Normally your distribution should provide the appropriate librtlsdr package.
If you go with your own installation of librtlsdr you have to specify the include path and library path. For example if you installed it in `/opt/install/librtlsdr` you have to add `-DRTLSDR_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/librtlsdr/include -DRTLSDR_LIBRARY=/opt/install/librtlsdr/lib/librtlsdr.a` to the cmake options

To install the library from a Debian/Ubuntu installation just do:

  - `sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev`

### HackRF support

For now HackRF support must be installed even if no HackRF device is connected.

If you install from source (https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/tree/master/host/libhackrf) in your own installation path you have to specify the include path and library path. For example if you installed it in `/opt/install/libhackrf` you have to add `-DHACKRF_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libhackrf/include -DHACKRF_LIBRARY=/opt/install/libhackrf/lib/libhackrf.a` to the cmake options.

To install the library from a Debian/Ubuntu installation just do:

  - `sudo apt-get install libhackrf-dev`

### Airspy support

For now Airspy support must be installed even if no Airspy device is connected.

If you install from source (https://github.com/airspy/host/tree/master/libairspy) in your own installation path you have to specify the include path and library path. For example if you installed it in `/opt/install/libairspy` you have to add `-DAIRSPY_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/install/libairspy/include -DHACKRF_LIBRARY=/opt/install/libairspy/lib/libairspy.a` to the cmake options.

To install the library from a Debian/Ubuntu installation just do:

  - `sudo apt-get install libairspy-dev`

### FreeBSD

* Install Port `comms/rtl-sdr`, `comms/hackrf`, `comms/airspy`

### macOS

* Install HomeBrew `rtl-sdr`, `hackrf`, `airspy`

## Installing

To install NGSoftFM, download and unpack the source code and go to the
top level directory. Then do like this:

 - `mkdir build`
 - `cd build`
 - `cmake ..`

CMake tries to find librtlsdr. If this fails, you need to specify
the location of the library in one the following ways:

 - `cmake .. -DRTLSDR_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/rtlsdr/include -DRTLSDR_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/rtlsdr/lib/librtlsdr.a`
 - `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/rtlsdr/lib/pkgconfig cmake ..`

Compile and install

 - `make -j8` (for machines with 8 CPUs)
 - `make install`

## Basic command options

 - `-t devtype` is mandatory and must be `rtlsdr` for RTL-SDR devices or `hackrf` for HackRF.
 - `-c config` Comma separated list of configuration options as key=value pairs or just key for switches. Depends on device type (see next paragraph).
 - `-d devidx` Device index, 'list' to show device list (default 0)
 - `-r pcmrate` Audio sample rate in Hz (default 48000 Hz)
 - `-M` Disable stereo decoding
 - `-R filename` Write audio data as raw S16_LE samples. Uuse filename `-` to write to stdout
 - `-W filename` Write audio data to .WAV file
 - `-P [device]` Play audio via ALSA device (default `default`). Use `aplay -L` to get the list of devices for your system
 - `-T filename` Write pulse-per-second timestamps. Use filename '-' to write to stdout
 - `-b seconds` Set audio buffer size in seconds
 - `-X` Shift pilot phase (for Quadrature Multipath Monitor) (-X is ignored under mono mode (-M))
 - `-U` Set deemphasis to 75 microseconds (default: 50)

## Modification by @jj1bdx

* Remove 19kHz pilot signal when the stereo PLL is locked
* Add equalizer to compensate 0th-hold aperture effect of phase discriminator output
* The compensation equalizer output parameters are pre-calculated and interpolated from 200kHz ~ 10MHz sampling rates
* Increase the number of FineTuner table size from 64 to 256
* Add quiet mode `-q`
* Add option `-X` for [Quadratic Multipath Monitor (QMM)](http://ham-radio.com/k6sti/qmm.htm) (This option is not effective in monaural mode (`-M` option))
* Add option `-U` to set deemphasis timing to 75 microseconds for North America (default: 50 microseconds for Europe/Japan)
* Add D/U ratio estimation based on I/F level: see <https://github.com/jj1bdx/rtl_power-fm-multipath> (this requires higher sampling rate above 900kHz)

## Features remaining same as the original NGSoftFM

* IF bandwidth: 200kHz (+-100kHz)
* Default sample rate for RTL-SDR: 1000kHz
